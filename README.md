# Technicolor Grid

A little web app created to challenge myself and explore more advanced features of React and CSS.

Modes are being added / updated periodically.

## To Do

- Have modes handled by [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) instead of props.
- Allow use of URL parameters to share or bookmark a specific mode.
    - Have "Hidden" modes only accessible via URL parameter.
- Refactor previously-made modes with new CSS Grid knowledge.
- Add mode Grid layout/positioning options.
- Add `touch` events in addition to `mouse` events.
- Make menu collapsible.
    - Add a "Random" button.
    - Add "Info."

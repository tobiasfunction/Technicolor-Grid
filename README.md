# Technicolor Grid

A little web app created to challenge myself and explore more advanced features of React and CSS.

Modes are being added / updated periodically.

## To Do

- Have modes handled by [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) instead of props.
- Allow use of URL parameters to share or bookmark a specific mode.
- Refactor previously-made modes with new CSS Grid knowledge.
- Add `touch` events in addition to `mouse` events.
